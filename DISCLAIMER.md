# ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is a **reference implementation** and **portfolio demonstration** of infrastructure patterns, tools, and automation techniques used in real-world DevOps engagements.

## 🔐 Confidentiality & NDA Compliance

- All configurations, domain names (`example.com`), IP addresses, credentials, and cryptographic material are **sanitized placeholders**.
- Real client deployments include additional hardening, monitoring, access controls, and compliance measures not shown here.
- Sensitive configurations (e.g., Postfix/Dovecot/LDAP integrations, PKI setups, Yggdrasil overlays) used in past engagements remain **confidential** and are **not included** in this repository.

## 🛠️ Usage Guidance

- This is **not a turnkey solution** — it is a **starting point** for discussion, adaptation, and extension.
- Always:
  - Review configurations for your threat model.
  - Rotate default/example credentials.
  - Test in isolated environments before production use.
  - Validate TLS, RBAC, and network policies.

## 📜 Licensing

- Code is provided under the **MIT License** (see `LICENSE`).
- Third-party components (e.g., Helm charts, Grafana dashboards) retain their original licenses — verify before commercial use.
